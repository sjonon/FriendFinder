# Friend Finder - Node and Express Servers

### Overview

On this site you have a link to a survey form that takes in input from the user and adds it to our api.  Once the user submits their survey, the program will then compare the user's entries to other survey entries and will display the name and picture of the person who is the best overall match.
The API can be viewed at any time by clicking on the link in the footer.
